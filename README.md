# REST-API-using-Flask

Now, what even is Flask, and RESR API?

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python that is well-suited for building REST APIs due to its flexibility and simplicity. REST APIs are a way to access web services using a set of operations. We can make Flask API more secure with basic authentication using Flask basic authentication. REST API is a basic architecture that many high-end APIs follow, it is basically a structure.


Here, in the code, I have made a video related API. Main.py is the main server, and test.py is the testing file which is to be run in cmd.


This repository is in refernce with my previous API repo, link is down here. in this one, I also tested the basic API I made using the POSTMAN tool.
